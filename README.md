# Advent of Code 2021

Hello there!

In this project, I will try to solve the daily puzzles provided by 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in the
[Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org).

If you are interested in better and more idiomatic solutions, check out
[Jetbrains' Tutorial Playlist for Advent of Code 2021 in Kotlin](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFc5cFwUnmy2hYx6k3TjjFLd7QXH2CjF).

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual event in December since 2015.

Every year, from the first day of December to the end of advent,
programming puzzles are published.

You can take part in the competition and try to get on the leaderboard 
or just solve the puzzles for fun!

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a versatile language for Android, iOS, JVM, Native or JavaScript.
If used on the JVM, Kotlin and Java work together seamlessly.

It also features null-safety by default, extension functions, data classes, and type-inference.

## Repository template

This repository uses the 
[Advent of Code Kotlin Template](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template) 
delivered by JetBrains.
